## Security

We have designed the Teleport Cloud environment to be secure; however we are still in the process of
scrutinizing and executing on our security roadmap and working with independent security
auditors to identify any gaps. Only once this is complete, the team will evaluate
whether the Teleport Cloud is ready for strict compliance use-cases.

## Compliance

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

## Managed Teleport Settings

SSH sessions are recorded [on nodes](../architecture/nodes.mdx#session-recording).
Teleport Cloud Proxy does not terminate SSH sessions when using OpenSSH and `tsh` sessions.
The Cloud Proxy terminates TLS for Application, Database and Kubernetes sessions.

## Data retention
Data retention cannot currently be configured by customers. Until we roll out the ability to make data retention configurable,
all customers are set to unlimited data retention. When data retention policies are introduced, customers will be contacted and
able to set their data retention with us.

Customers whose subscriptions lapse will have all session recordings, audit, and cluster state deleted between 7 and 30 days of the lapse.

## High Availability

### Auth Service
The Teleport [auth service](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/authentication/) is deployed within the AWS us-west-2 region in 4 availability zones, and can tolerate a single zone failure. AWS guarantees [99.99%](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/) of monthly uptime.

### Proxies
The Teleport [proxy service](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/proxy/) can be deployed to multiple AWS regions around the world for low-latency access to distributed infrastructure.

- us-west-2 (default)
- us-east-1
- eu-central-1
- ap-southeast-1
- sa-east-1

The multi-region option is currently opt-in by default. Once you have an account, please reach out to your account manager, customer success engineer, or support@goteleport.com. A future update will expand the region availability and make all regions available by default.


## Service Level Agreement

Teleport Cloud commits to an SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=) of monthly uptime,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month. As we continue to invest in the
cloud product and infrastructure, the SLA will be increased.
